1. Implementation:
    a. was able to use set up OWASP ZAP to perform the attack scans for GET methods
    b. could not perform the attack scans for POST methods since this would require additional setup on my machine.  Thus,
        to supplement this issue, I manually reviewed the code and try curl commands.

2.  I worked on this lab my own.  However, I was confused at first thinking that I did not start the server correctly so I 
    asked Loi to help.  He looked at my screen and confirmed that it was running.

3. I spent 8-10 hours.
