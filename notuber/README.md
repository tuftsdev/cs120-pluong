1. Implementation:
    a. updated map.js file from lab #8 
    b. displayed all vehicles from the XMLHttpRequest
    c. calculated distance using geometry library
    d. added polyline between my location and closest vehicle
    e. displayed each vehicle's name and how far it is away from me when clicking on the car icon
    f. displayed the closest car to me and my location information via latitude and longitude

2.  I coded this lab on my own, but researched information on the web.  Loi Truong also showed me how to debug and provided suggestions on fixing some of the errors
    that I encountered.

3. I spent 4-5 hours.
