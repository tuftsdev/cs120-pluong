1. Implementation:
    a. updated map.js file from lab #10; just one line of code got changed 
    b. updated inde.js file to return the json object with 6 vehicles; using some random values for lat and lng; 
        using crypto randombytes for random id and defaulted date time for created_at
    c. added insert queries in an attempt to complete beyond point #1

2.  I coded this lab on my own, but researched information on the web.  

3. I spent 12-15 hours.
