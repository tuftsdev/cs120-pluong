1. Implementation:
    a. created index.html and copied the contents per the lab instructions
    b. created responsive.css file

2.  I am working on this lab my own.  I have been researching the responsive topics over the webs.

3. I spent 3 hours so far; still need to figure out why the image wouldn't be displayed even though W3C CSS indicated no syntax error.
