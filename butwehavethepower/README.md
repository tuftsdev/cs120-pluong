1. Implementation:
    a. displayed lyrics by verse based on timing of the beginning of each verse in the video
    b. created style.css file
    c. did not add code to handle when a viewer pause the video and replay; assumed viewer would watch without interruption 

2.  I worked on this lab my own.

3. I spent 1-2 hour.
