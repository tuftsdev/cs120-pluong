1. Implementation:
    a. displayed lyrics by verse based on timing of the beginning of each verse in the video
    b. created style.css file
    c. did not add code to handle when a viewer pause the video and replay; assumed viewer would watch without interruption
    d. versed remain displayed until the next one; it would be nicer if they disappear once the singing stops. 

2.  I worked on this lab my own.  However, I run into the issue where my lyrics displayed so quick so Loi Truong helped me.  I used minutes instead of seconds in my logic.

3. I spent 1-3 hour.
